## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses a predefined logic that maps each mood to a book suggestion:

| Mood | Book | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Happy | *The Little Prince* | A philosophical story about love and meaning |
| Sad | *Les Misérables* | A story of justice and redemption |
| Calm | *One Hundred Years of Solitude* | A magical multi-generational tale |
| Excited | *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* | A thrilling adventure full of magic |

You can later extend this logic to use a **database**, **API**, or even an **AI model** to make it smarter.
